        <p>My favourite hobby is reading.I like it because it increases my vocabulary, information and also improves my information.My favourite books are the Harry Potter series, Percy Jackson and the How To Train Your Dragon series.How to train your Dragon was written by Cressida Cowell.It's a fantastic series about a boy who has a special relationship to dragons.Percy Jackson is about Greek Myths and Harry Potter which I'm sure you've heard of, is a series of books about an orphan boy who travels through the mysteries of magic, with his enemy.Reading reduces stress by 68%.I've heard that if you read a book with a lot of words, you can read faster than with a book with less words.This is why reading is my favourite hobby.

        <p>
            At 6:30 A.M in the morning, Peter Fisher woke up as he usually did.Like his usual pattern he went to the kitchen and made breakfast for his absolutely dreadful Uncle, Aunt and Cousin.Today was his birthday but what did they care?They regarded him as an annoying and naughty little orphan boy.You see his parents died when he was only a baby in a heart attack.That’s what his Aunt told him anyway.Today he made toasted bread and scrambled eggs.Then he sat down on the living room sofa and just sat and thought.At about 7:00 pm his uncle Barry and Aunt Rose entered the living room.Uncle Barry said in a very impatient tone to Peter “Where’s my breakfast boy?”. “In the kitchen!”, Peter replied. “Well get it for us!” said his Aunt Rose in a very smug voice.Peter served breakfast to his uncle and aunt when his cousin Manny entered the dining room. “Breakfast!”, Manny said in a very happy voice as if he was about to be the richest person on the planet.After a while his uncle finished his breakfast and said to Peter, “Is that the best you could do?”.Peter was used to this statement since his family always said that the breakfast was dreadful even though they thoroughly enjoyed it. “Well if you don’t like it, maybe you should make breakfast.” replied Peter. “Don’t take that tone with me boy.You’re lucky we decided to raise you.You ought to be grateful to us!”.Peter said to himself in a very sarcastic voice “Yes, they’re raised me really well.”.Peter only got the left overs of each meal so he had to savour every single bite of his breakfast..After some time he and his fat cousin Manny went to school.Peter didn’t have any friends.Manny had many friends and they all bullied Peter.In fact everybody at school called Peter ‘Poopy Peter’ all because of an accident that happened in 1st grade.You see once when Peter was eating lunch he got up to wash his hands he accidently tooted or farted or whatever you could call it.Bottom line is he had no friends.You remember that I told you it was his birthday today?He was 11 today.The highlight of his day was that Manny and his gang of goons didn’t bully him today.They were busy with some other kid.After school, Peter went home.When he was having dinner, there was a knock on the door.It was very loud and no one seemed to want to open it.There was another knock and still nobody opened it.Then there were many loud loud knocks and finally the person who was knocking smashed the door off its hinges.What they saw was a huge man about 7 feet tall.

        <p>The woman in the picture above is Joanne Rowling.Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales.
            <br>
            <br>
            Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to school. Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in 1990, before the Harry Potter books were published. Jo also has a younger sister, Di.
            <br>
            <br>
            The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books,’’ she has said. “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”
            <br>
            She inspired me because after reading the Harry Potters I was inspired to write my own story.
